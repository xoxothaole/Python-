# COVID-19 Analysis 
### Objective 
With a background in microbiology and experience in the pharmacy setting, I've witnessed how public health data represents far more than numbers â€” it reflects real people, real outcomes. This project was inspired by the stark disparities I observed in healthcare infrastructure and pandemic response between countries during COVID-19. Using Python for comprehensive data analysis and visualization, this project examines global COVID-19 patterns to reveal inequities in testing access, healthcare outcomes, and pandemic preparedness across different regions. The analysis goes beyond surface-level statistics to uncover meaningful insights about global health disparities, with the goal of presenting data-driven evidence that can inform public health policy and highlight areas where targeted interventions are most needed.

### Context 
This project leverages multiple datasets to provide data-driven insights into the pandemic's progression, helping visualize how different regions were affected and how key metrics evolved over time. This analysis is particulary valuable for understanding testing effciency, mortality patterns, and recovery trends acorss different geographical regions and WHO-defined areas. 

### Tools and Methodologies 
- Python- Primary programming language for data analysis
- Pandas- Data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis
- NumPy- Numerical computing and array operations
- Plotly- Interactive data visualizations and dashboard creation
- Matplotlib- Additional plotting and visualization support
- WordCloud- Text visualization for COVID-related conditions
